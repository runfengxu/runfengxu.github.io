- use yaml files to configure application services
- can start all services with a single command: docker compose up
- can stop all services with a single command: docker compose down
- can scale up selected services when required

### step :
 - check verision : docker-compose -v
 - install : pip install -U docker-compose
 - create docker-compose file in any location
     - name: docker-compose.yml
 - Check validity of file by command: docker-compose config
 - Run docker-compose.yml file by command: docker-compose up -d(detached mode)
