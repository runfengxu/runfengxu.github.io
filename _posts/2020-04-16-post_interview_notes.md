Today I Had an interview with Vouched company. It is a small company whose business mainly focused on fraud detection on documents and human faces.

thoughts on the interview:
    - I personally feel like the interviewer does not know much about Computer Vision technologies and algorithms. I had a hard time understand what the companies is doing and how they are doing it. The interviewer did not reveal any algorithm and tools they are using.
    - they expect candidate to be familiar with unit test and integration test tools which I've never used.
    - I am quite confident about the knowledge part and deep learning part. Seems like they are not using very stage-of-art method and not trying to make improvement.
    - My knowledge and experience lies more on the deep learning methods, while they seem to be using some traditional methods.
    - did not fully prepared a brief description of my research experience and knowledge set.
    - did not understand the company's business and their techniques very well.
    - speak slow but clearly is better than speak fast and unclearly.

should keep researching on :
    - how to recognize text in a picture
