## From DH to ECDH

### motivation:
 we want to remain the hardness of the regarding DLP while reduce the key size dramatically.
 
 Then we need to find a public key family. the idea is to find another cyclic group beyond Z*p in which the DLP is difficult.
 

### EC
 The equation of curve in EC:
 
 >   $$y^2 = x^3+ax+b$$

the elliptic curve over $Z^*p$ is all points on the above equation together with a imaginary point at infinity, where $a,b\in Z^*p$  and $4a^3+27b^2$ $\neq$ 0 mod p.

we want to have a cyclic group for DLP, we need:

 - set of element
 - group operation(closed,associative)
 - a generator(the element which order equals to the group cardinality)

### '+' operator : ###

how to perform 'P+Q' geometrically:

### adding: ###
    > draw a straight line of PQ and it intersects the curve at another point, take the mirror of that point by X axis.

### point doubling(P+P) ###
    > draw the tangential line for P and get the intersect point then take the mirror of that point by the X axis.

A formal solution to compute:

$X_3 = S^2 - X_1 - X_2$ mod p (1);

$Y_3 = S(X_1-X_3)-Y_1$ mod p   (2);

$S = \{\begin{matrix} \frac{Y_2-Y_1}{X_2-X_1} mod\  p\ \  for \ point\  addition\\\frac{3X^2+a}{2Y_1} mod \ p\ \  for \ point \ doubling   \end{matrix}$

>  note: in DLP, '/' operator mean inverse.   $A/B = A*B^-1$

> what is the identity element?  P+I = P for all P. ( The imaginary point)

> what is the reverse of one point : P = (X,Y) , -P = (X,-Y)

> How may points lies on the curve E(#E, the cardinality of this group) is computationally hard.

> Given an elliptic curve E modulo P, the number of points on the curve is denoted By #E. and $P+1-2\sqrt{P}$ <#E<  $P+1+2\sqrt{P}$

### ECDH ###

The Discrete Logarithm problem:

given E,P,T s.t dP=T, it is computatinally hard to compute d.

'd is the number of hops on the curve'

ECDH:  'd' private key, $d\in$ {2,.....,#E}mod p

#### The process: ####

 - 1 st phase: given E: $y^2=x^3+ax+b$, primititive element P(xp,yp) //the generator as public key
 - 2nd phase:
    
    Alice : chose a from {2,.....,#E-1} , A = a*P(P+P+....+P,a times)
    
    Bob : chose b from {2,.....,#E-1} , B = b*P(P+P+....+P,b times)

    and they exchange A and B.

    Alice: (a*B) = $(X_{AB},Y_{AB})$ , Bob : (b*A) = $(X_{AB},Y_{AB})$

    use $X_{AB}$  as the shared key.

    > personally, I think the hardness comes from the '+" operation in ECDH,
    EC only increase the cardinality by at most $\sqrt{P}$, however, In every '+' operation, we need to do a inverse computation which almost increases the hardness by $\log{P}$.
