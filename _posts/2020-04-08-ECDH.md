## From DH to ECDH

### motivation:
 we want to remain the hardness of the regarding DLP while reduce the key size dramatically.
 
 Then we need to find a public key family. the idea is to find another cyclic group beyond Z*p in which the DLP is difficult.
 
 The equation of curve in EC:
 
 >   $$y^2 = x^3+ax+b$$

the elliptic curve over $Z^*p$ is all points on the above equation together with a imaginary point at infinity, where $a,b\in Z^*p$  and $4a^3+27b^2$ $\neq$ 0 mod p.

we want to have a cyclic group for DLP, we need:

 - set of element
 - group operation(closed,associative)
 - a generator(the element which order equals to the group cardinality)

### '+' operator : ###

how to perform 'P+Q' geometrically:

### adding: ###
    > draw a straight line of PQ and it intersects the curve at another point, take the mirror of that point by X axis.

### point doubling(P+P) ###
    > draw the tangential line for P and get the intersect point then take the mirror of that point by the X axis.

A formal solution to compute:

$X_3 = S^2 - X_1 - X_2$ mod p (1);

$Y_3 = S(X_1-X_3)-Y_1$ mod p   (2);

$S = \{\begin{matrix} \frac{Y_2-Y_1}{X_2-X_1} mod\  p\ \  for \ point\  addition\\\frac{3X^2+a}{2Y_1} mod \ p\ \  for \ point \ doubling   \end{matrix}$

>note: in DLP, '/' operator mean inverse.   $A/B = A*B^-1$
