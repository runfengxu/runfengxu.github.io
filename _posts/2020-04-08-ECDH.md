## From DH to ECDH

### motivation:
 we want to remain the hardness of the regarding DLP while reduce the key size dramatically.
 
 Then we need to find a public key family. the idea is to find another cyclic group beyond Z*p in which the DLP is difficult.
 
 The equation of curve in EC:
 
 >  \[
     {y^2 = sd}
 \]
