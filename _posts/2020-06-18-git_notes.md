## **Shallow Clone:** where you can use clone depth to define how deep your clone should go.

> for -depth 1, Git only get the latest coly of the relevent files. It can save you a lot of space and time.

### problems with Git Shallow Clone
Even though you can push code from a shallow clone, it might take longer because of the calculations between the remote and the local server. So if you are committing code regularly from a local copy, it probably makes sense to use a full clone.

## Multiple Branch Option
When you use the –depth flag with clone command, Git assumes the –single-branch flag by default. But you can use –no-single-branch flag to tell Git to get histories from the specified depth of each branch.
